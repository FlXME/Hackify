**_What is Hackify?_**

Many of you certainly know the game Watch Dogs in which they often use a glitch animation which looks kind of cool.
It looks like this (not created or generated by me):

Hackify can create such images ~ just better and heavily customizable.
When creating animations with Hackify it will look kind of like this. (As I said, the output is heavily customizable):

**Configure as desired (if you want to)**
- Speed
- Characteristics of glitches (thickness, length, etc.)
- Number of glitches per frame
- Number of frames / length of the animation
- Creates a folder with every single frame for further processing

Hackify will apply a custom GraphicsControlExtention to the final GIF in order to keep the glitches planned when working with multiple frames and transparency.

All GIFs generated with Hackify are highly compatible with most devices, browsers and even game engines. No weird transparency or other (unwanted) glitches.

**Supported file types**
- GIF
- JPEG
- PNG
- BMP
- EPS
- ICN(S)
- IM
- JPEG 2000
- MSP
- PCX
- PPM
- SPIDER
- TIFF
- WebP
- XBM
- and much more ...


**_But why?_**

Even though the effect is easy to recreate with any half-decent image manipulation program it is still very time consuming to do this frame by frame. The transparency is extremely annoying as well.
I couldn't find any tool nearly recreating the thing I want out there and decided to create my own one.

**_Download_**

**Bundled and ready to go with one click:** [Hackify.exe (via Google Drive)](http://v.ht/Hackify)

Or clone this Git... it's just python.


**_How to use?_**

1. Download as [Standalone](http://v.ht/Hackify) or as source (It has been tested with Python 2.7)
2. Start it (It's a command-line interface)
3. Enter the image filename (It starts searching from the working directory. You can just enter the absolute path though)
4. Tweak settings or just press enter to use the default values
5. Let it render
6. ???
7. Profit!
